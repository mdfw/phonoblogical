Since I read Digital Telepathy's "[The Complete Guide to the UX Product Design Process](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/the-complete-product-design-process)" I've been wanting to try it on for size. We're not going to do everything since it involves some steps we don't need, but I'd like to do what we can. So, first step is **Defining Product Vision** and it's specific step **The Future Press Release**:

> An effective method to realizing a product vision is working backwards by writing a press release. Imagine as if the product is released into the wild. Now write a press release that introduces the product to the public, why it exists, what problem it solves, and why it matters to prospective users. This can be an individual exercise or can involve team members and stakeholders. Future press releases are fantastic for collaboration and alignment, serving as a beacon for the life of the project. You can learn all about how to write a product vision press release on our blog.

I've never written a press release, but the article links to a fantasictially helpful post at hubspot "[How to Write a Press Release](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht)".

Having read that, here's a pass at our press release:

# Music bloggers rejoice as new Blog engine focused on music is released

_The Internet_: Today, Mark Wiliams, announces the release of a new blogging engine for music lovers: Phonoblogical. Available as open source software on Github, the world's biggest software development service, the engine supplies a strong personal blogging engine with music tables to suppliment the reviews. 

Mark said, "I wanted to write about music, but was frustrated with other engines' lack of annotation. Also, everyone should write their own blogging software, right?"

Core features include:
* Each blog post can be associated with track, album and artist information.
* Each track, album and artist allows others to comment and review them as well - if the owner wishes.
* Designed to be wicked fast.
* Built on top of CouchDB to allow scaling and simple replication and backup of content.
