Phonoblogical is a new project with the following objectives:
1. Write a music blogging system with content replication built in. 
2. Blog about each step to practice writing (aka working out loud)

Wait, a blog about a blogging system - that's so meta! 

*True*

However, writing can [improve your code](https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/become-a-better-developer-3-ways-writing-will-expand-your-mind-improve-your-code-and-grow-your-career/) and thought process.

In addition, I have some music ideas I want to curate and while I certainly create something in Wordpress or similar, what's the fun in that? Let's get some design and coding practice on something I want to create! So, off we goâ€¦
