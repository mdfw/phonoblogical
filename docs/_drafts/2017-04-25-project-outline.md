Since I read Digital Telepathy's "[The Complete Guide to the UX Product Design Process](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/the-complete-product-design-process)" I've been wanting to try it on for size. We're not going to do everything since it involves some steps we don't need, but I'd like to do what we can. So, first step is **Defining Product Vision** and it's specific step **The Future Press Release**:

> An effective method to realizing a product vision is working backwards by writing a press release. Imagine as if the product is released into the wild. Now write a press release that introduces the product to the public, why it exists, what problem it solves, and why it matters to prospective users. This can be an individual exercise or can involve team members and stakeholders. Future press releases are fantastic for collaboration and alignment, serving as a beacon for the life of the project. You can learn all about how to write a product vision press release on our blog.
